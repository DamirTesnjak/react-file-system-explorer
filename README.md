# react-file-system-explorer
This repository is the part of my personal project, **an experiment** of writing the React app - File Explorer,
<br> and you must regard it as such. Do not expect a clone of File Explorer in Windows, because it is not!!!
<br>
<br>**App is very buggy but you can have a fun playing with it!**
<br>
<br>
<br>Installation: download repository and run the command ```npm i``` in command prompt terminal
<br> in the root folder of a project
<br>
<br>To run the application you must run ```npm start``` in command prompt terminal.
<br> in the root folder of a project.
<br>
To successfuly run the application you must download the backend part,
<br> which you can find here: https://github.com/DamirTesnjak/react-file-system-explorer-server
<br> and follow the instructions there.

**Both backend and frontend must be running to use the application**
