# react-file-system-explorer
This repository is the part of my personal project, **an experiment** of writing the React app - File Explorer,
<br> and you must regard it as such. Do not expect a clone of File Explorer in Windows, because it is not!!!
<br>Keep in mind that application is still under development
<br>
<br>**Have a fun playing with it!**
<br>
<br>
<br>Installation: download repository and run the command ```npm i``` in command prompt terminal
<br> in the root folder of a project
<br>
<br>To run the application you must run ```npm start``` in command prompt terminal.
<br> in the root folder of a project.
<br>
To successfuly run the application you must download the backend part,
<br> which you can find here: https://github.com/DamirTesnjak/react-file-system-explorer-server
<br> and follow the instructions there.

**Both backend and frontend must be running to use the application**

**Implemented features on frontend & backend**
- Browsing accross folders by double clicking
- Copy, paste & delete folders or files
- Tree view navigation
- Address toolbar navigation
- Moving files
- Moving folders (in progress)
